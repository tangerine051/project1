# Additional information

This is an updated list of any further information about the project -- e.g. typos, clarifications, FAQ.

### 21/10/2022

- **Typo**: in Task 2, `read_user_info()` should be replaced by `read_subject_info()`. Corrected in the template.

### 4/11/2022

- **Clarification**: in Task 1, the NumPy array `info` returned by `read_subject_info()` should be an array of **floating point numbers**.
- **Clarification**: your code should work without having to move files out of their folders, or to move your notebook inside the data folder. You can specify **relative paths** for files you need to read -- for instance, in Task 1, use `'dataset/subject_info.txt'` as the file name to read the information from.
